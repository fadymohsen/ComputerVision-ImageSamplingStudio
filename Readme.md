# Image Processing Studio



## Description
Image Processing Studio is a comprehensive application developed using PyQt5 for performing various image processing operations. The application provides a user-friendly interface for applying noise and filters, edge detection, thresholding, curve adjustment, normalization, equalization, frequency domain filters, and RGB histogram analysis on images.

## Features
- **Browse User Interface:** The first step is adding a new image through this UI.

- **After Adding an Image:** It will be automatically uploaded to the next tab widgets for all features (for better user experience).

- **Noise Addition and Filtration:** Add various types of noise to images and apply different filters to reduce noise.

- **Edge Detection:** Implement multiple edge detection algorithms to highlight the edges in images.

- **Curves:** Analyze and plot Histogram and Distribution Curve.

- **Thresholding:** Apply global and local thresholding techniques to segment images.

- **RGB Histograms:** Analyze and plot the RGB histograms of images.

- **Normalization and Equalization:** Normalize and equalize the histogram of images for better contrast.

- **Frequency Domain Filters:** Apply filters in the frequency domain to enhance or suppress certain features of images.

## Installation
To run the Image Processing Studio, you will need to install the following dependencies:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyQt5
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- PyQtGraph

You can install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install pyqt5 opencv-python numpy pyqtgraph
```
<br>



## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the project files.
3. Run the application with the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
4. The application will start in full-screen mode. You can toggle between full-screen and normal mode by pressing the `Esc` key.
5. Use the "Browse Image" button to load an image for processing.
6. Select the desired processing options from the tabs and apply them to the image.
